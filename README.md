# Electricity Billing System

This project is an **Electricity Billing System** designed to automate the billing process for consumers, allowing easy and efficient management of electricity usage and billing details. The system facilitates the calculation of bills based on usage, rates, and other parameters. It is developed as part of my academic project.

## Features:
- **User Registration & Login**: Allows customers to register, login, and view their usage history.
- **Bill Calculation**: Automatically calculates electricity bills based on consumption and rate slabs.
- **Bill Generation**: Generates and displays the final bill with details such as total consumption, total cost, and due date.
- **Payment Management**: Customers can view their previous payments and make payments directly through the system.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the system.
- **MySQL**: The database used for storing user data, billing records, and payment history.
- **JDBC**: Java Database Connectivity for interacting with the MySQL database.
- **Swing**: GUI for creating the front-end interface of the application.

## Database:
The system uses a MySQL database with tables for user accounts, billing records, payment history, and electricity usage data.

## How to Run:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kul1924/electricity-billingsystem.git
